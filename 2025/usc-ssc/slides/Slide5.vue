      In physics, Maxwell's equations are a set of coupled partial differential
      equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation
      of classical electromagnetism. For example, Gauss's law for magnetism is
      written as <Latex expression="\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0" />, which shows that
      there are no magnetic monopoles.

      The integral form of Amp√®re's circuital law is given by:
